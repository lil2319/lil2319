🌟 About Me

Hi there! I’m Lindsey I'm a beginner software developer with a big imagination, a love of learning, and a soft spot for building apps that make life a little more fun (and a lot more organized).

Before diving into tech, I spent years working in veterinary medicine — caring for animals, connecting with pet parents, and mastering the art of staying calm in chaos. It taught me how to problem-solve under pressure, communicate with empathy, and keep learning every single day — all skills that have carried over beautifully into coding.

My journey into tech didn’t start with a classroom — it started with curiosity. I’ve always loved the feeling of figuring things out, whether it's a tricky crochet pattern or a chunk of code that finally works. After switching gears from vet med to software, I dove into programming head-first and haven’t looked back since.

I’m currently learning full-stack development through a bootcamp and building passion projects along the way — from a reading log app for book lovers like me, to a stitch counter for fellow crafters. Every project teaches me something new, and I’m always chasing that "a-ha!" moment that comes with making ideas real.
